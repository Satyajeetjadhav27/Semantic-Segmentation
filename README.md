# Semantic Segmentation Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on the task of semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel of an image into one of several categories. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to achieve pixel-wise classification with high precision across various applications.

## Data Overview
The data for this project, specifically targeting colon segmentation, is sourced from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon at [http://medicaldecathlon.com/](http://medicaldecathlon.com/). The dataset consists of 126 3D images in NIfTi (.nii.gz) format for training, with 64 images reserved for testing. To enhance our model's performance, we've allocated the last 26 images from the training data as a validation set. This provides us with 100 3D images for training and 26 for validation purposes.

## Preparation of Slices
To prepare the data for our model, we process the 3D images by slicing them along the Z-axis. Each pixel value is normalized within the range of 0 to 1. Given that this data originates from CT scans, the intensity of the images typically ranges from -1000 HU (Hounsfield Units) to 3500 HU. This normalization is crucial for handling the diverse radiodensity present in medical images, allowing our model to effectively learn from various tissue types.

## UNET Model
Our model architecture is based on the UNET framework, with a slight modification where the encoder part is replaced with a VGG16 network pretrained on ImageNet data. This choice leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of VGG16, enhancing our model's ability to understand and segment complex medical images. UNET's architecture is particularly suited for medical image segmentation due to its ability to capture fine details and maintain spatial resolution through the segmentation process.

## Loss Function
To address the class imbalance commonly observed in medical images, where the area of interest (foreground) is much smaller than the background, we employ a combined loss function. This function is a weighted sum of Dice loss and categorical cross-entropy, optimizing both the segmentation accuracy and the pixel-wise classification performance. The Dice loss component is particularly effective in managing the imbalance by focusing on the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth.

## Training Details
The training of our model spans 100 epochs, requiring approximately 12 hours on NVIDIA GPUs available on Kaggle. This extensive training period ensures that our model thoroughly learns from the data, optimizing its performance for accurate segmentation outcomes.
